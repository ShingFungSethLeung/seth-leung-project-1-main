        <p class="right-text">The Yuan Dynasty, established in 1271 by Kublai Khan, was a significant era in Chinese history, marking the first time that the entire country was ruled by a foreign power, the Mongols. This dynasty emerged after the Mongol conquests that swept through much of Asia, leading to the unification of China under Mongolian rule. Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, moved the capital to Beijing and promoted policies that facilitated trade and cultural exchange along the Silk Road. The Yuan Dynasty is notable for its advancements in art, literature, and science, as well as for the introduction of new technologies and cultural practices from various regions.</p>

            <p class="left-text">Despite its achievements, the Yuan Dynasty faced numerous challenges, including resistance from the native Han Chinese and internal strife among the Mongols themselves. Over time, heavy taxation and natural disasters led to widespread discontent among the populace. By the late 14th century, these pressures culminated in a series of rebellions, ultimately resulting in the fall of the Yuan Dynasty and the rise of the Ming Dynasty in 1368. The legacy of the Yuan period remains significant, as it laid the groundwork for the cultural and economic developments that would shape subsequent Chinese history.</p>
