            <p class="main-text">China's history spans over 3,000 years, marked by the rise and fall of dynasties, each contributing to a rich cultural tapestry.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Beginning with the Xia Dynasty around 2100 BCE, it evolved through significant periods such as the Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, which saw advancements in philosophy, governance, and technology.</p>

            <p class="main-text">The introduction of Confucianism and Taoism shaped societal values, while China's innovations, including papermaking and the compass, transformed global development.</p>
            
            <p class="main-text">The dynastic cycle, characterized by the "Mandate of Heaven," influenced political legitimacy. After centuries of imperial rule, the Qing Dynasty fell in the early 20th century, leading to the establishment of the Republic of China and later the People's Republic in 1949, which marked a shift towards modernization and economic reform, positioning China as a major global power today.</p>
